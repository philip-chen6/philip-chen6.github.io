# Philip Chen

Hi, I'm Philip! Welcome! I'm currently studying Data Science (and minoring in Music) at UC San Diego. I'm passionate about solving impactful real-world problems with machine learning, tinkering with agents, and building meaningful applications. Also always looking to jam (ðŸŽ¸) with people and improve my music skills!

If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me at **philipchen247@gmail.com**.

## Experience

- **Undergraduate Research Assistant â€” Rose Lab, UC San Diego**  
  Conducting research on LLM steerability and mechanistic interpretability, exploring sparse autoencoder representations and steering vector composition to better understand language model behavior.

- **Software Developer â€” Triton Software Engineering**  
  Full-stack developer for nonprofit web applications using the MERN stack, owning backend API development and frontend features while operating in agile, industry-style team settings.
  
- **AI Research Fellow â€” Algoverse**  
  Built a deep-learning pipeline for surgical phase detection using a 3D CNN on high-dimensional video data; collaborated with hospitals and published an abstract at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress.

- **Student Researcher â€” Computer Science and Engineering Society, UC San Diego**  
  Collaborating on Musescore+, a research project developing deep learning technologies for musicians, including automatic arrangement, sheet music generation, and transpositions.

- **SPIS Mentor - Computer Science and Engineering Department, UC San Diego**  
  Mentoring a cohort of incoming freshmen in computer science topics including machine learning, algorithmic problem solving, web development, and robotics, fostering strong technical foundations.

- **Mobile App Dev Intern - Mobile Systems Design Lab, UC San Diego**  
  Designed and implemented responsive interfaces with React Native and built backend services (Node.js/Express) for VirtualPT, a computer-vision-based physical therapy app.

## Projects

- **Clari.f.ai (NVIDIA AI Agent Hackathon)**  
  Multi-agent research assistant that parses academic papers, summarizes key insights, and generates animated educational videos using LangChain + NeMo Agent Toolkit.

- **FLASHcard (Hackathon Project)**  
  Browser extension that uses NLP to convert web articles into focused flashcards and exports them directly to Anki.

- **Anomaly Detection Machine Learning (NSF ML Hackathon)**  
  Designed a TensorFlow-based transformer autoencoder with variational autoencoders and positional encoding to detect anomalies in gravitational wave telemetry data.

- **Music Recommender System**  
  Built a proof-of-concept ML model to recommend similar songs based on audio features and metadata.
