# Philip Chen

Hi, I'm Philip! Welcome! I'm currently studying Data Science (and minoring in Math and Music) at UC San Diego. I'm passionate about solving impactful real-world problems with machine learning, tinkering with agents, and building meaningful applications. Also always looking to jam (ðŸŽ¸) with people and improve my music skills!

If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me at **philipchen247@gmail.com**.

  Conducting research on LLM steerability and reasoning, exploring steering vector composition and state of the art methods to better understand language model behavior; submitted paper accepted to Foundations of Reasoning in Language Models (FoRLM) workshop at NeurIPS 2025.

- **Software Developer & Engineering Manager â€” Triton Software Engineering**  
  Full-stack developer for nonprofit web applications using the MERN stack, owning backend API development and frontend features while operating in agile, industry-style team settings.
  Selected as 2026 Engineering Manager to lead development cycles, Agile sprints, and CI/CD.
  
- **AI Research Fellow â€” Algoverse**  
  Built a deep-learning pipeline for surgical phase detection using a 3D CNN on high-dimensional video data; collaborated with hospitals and submitted an abstract accepted at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress.

- **Student Researcher â€” Computer Science and Engineering Society, UC San Diego**  
  Collaborating on Musescore+, a research project developing deep learning technologies for musicians, including automatic arrangement, sheet music generation, and transpositions.

- **SPIS Mentor - Computer Science and Engineering Department, UC San Diego**  
  Mentoring a cohort of incoming freshmen in computer science topics including machine learning, algorithmic problem solving, web development, and robotics, fostering strong technical foundations.

- **Mobile App Dev Intern - Mobile Systems Design Lab, UC San Diego**
